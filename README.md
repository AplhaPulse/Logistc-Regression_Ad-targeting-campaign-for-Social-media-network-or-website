# Logistic Regression for Ad Targeting Optimization

This repository provides a Python implementation of logistic regression for optimizing ad targeting based on user features.

## Purpose:

* Predicts the probability of a user clicking on an ad (click-through rate, CTR).
* Identifies user features that are most predictive of ad clicks.
* Enables optimization of ad targeting to reach users with higher click probabilities.
* Provides a framework for understanding and improving the effectiveness of digital advertising campaigns.

## Implementation:

* Uses Python's `scikit-learn` library to implement logistic regression.
* Processes user features such as demographics, browsing history, and online behavior.
* Trains a logistic regression model to predict CTR.
* Evaluates model performance using metrics relevant to ad targeting (e.g., AUC-ROC, log loss).
* Provides feature importance analysis to identify key predictors of ad clicks.

## Usage:

1.  Install necessary Python packages (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`).
2.  Prepare your user data, including relevant features and click labels.
3.  Run the provided Python script (`ad_targeting_logistic.py`).
4.  Specify parameters such as regularization strength and feature selection methods.
5.  Interpret output:
    * The script outputs model evaluation metrics (AUC-ROC, log loss).
    * Feature importance scores are provided to identify key predictors.
    * Predicted click probabilities for users are generated.
    * Insights into optimal ad targeting strategies are provided.

## Key Concepts:

* **Logistic Regression:** A statistical model for predicting binary outcomes (click/no click).
* **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** The percentage of users who click on an ad.
* **Feature Importance:** Measures the influence of each user feature on the predicted CTR.
* **AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve):** A metric for evaluating the model's ability to distinguish between click and no-click events.
* **Log Loss (Cross-Entropy Loss):** A metric that penalizes incorrect probability predictions.
* **Ad Targeting:** Selecting the most relevant audience for an ad campaign.

## Output:

* Model evaluation metrics (AUC-ROC, log loss).
* Feature importance scores.
* Predicted click probabilities for users.
* Recommendations for ad targeting optimization.
